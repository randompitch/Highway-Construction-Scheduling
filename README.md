This repository contains the project that I made for the Data Structures and Algorithms Lab in semester 3, along with my two team mates.
The project made use of Data Structures like **Arrays, Graph & Priority Queues and Algorithms** like **Dijkstra's algorithm & Banker's Algorithm**.
Language used: C++
